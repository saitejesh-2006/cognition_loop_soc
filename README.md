# Cognition Loop: Building Autonomous ReAct Agents

Welcome to the Cognition Loop. This project bridges the gap between basic conversational chatbots and autonomous, action-driven AI systems.

## The Final Vision

Current consumer LLMs are passive systems: they require a user prompt, generate text, and halt. This project shifts that paradigm. Over the next eight weeks, you will engineer an active, autonomous agent capable of reasoning through multi-step problems and executing actions in the real world.

By the end of this project, you will build an orchestration engine capable of executing tasks such as:
> *"Query the internal documentation database to find the user's preferred music genre, then open a web browser, navigate to YouTube or Spotify, and autonomously search for and play a playlist matching that mood."*

To achieve this, the agent will independently:
1. Formulate a plan.
2. Utilize a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool to search internal documents.
3. Utilize browser automation tools to interact with live websites.
4. Process the observations and complete the objective without human intervention.

##  Week 1: Reading & Technical Resources

Before writing the control logic, it is critical to understand the underlying architecture of modern AI. Review these resources before starting the tasks.

### 1. Conceptual Foundations
* **The Mechanics of LLMs:** [[1hr Talk] Intro to Large Language Models by Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g) — Demystifies how standard generative models are trained and why they hallucinate. Understand the training pipeline, tokenization, and the fundamental limitations of standard generative models.
* **The Shift to Agentic AI:** [Andrew Ng Explores The Rise Of AI Agents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrRD7r7y7NY) — Explains the conceptual shift from direct prompting to systems that utilize reflection, tool use, and planning.
* **The ReAct Framework:** [Prompt Engineering Guide: ReAct](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/react) — Differentiate between standard prompting, Chain of Thought, and the ReAct methodology.
* **4Data Serialization (JSON & APIs)** - Understand why autonomous agents rely on strictly structured JSON data rather than conversational text to trigger external code.
### 2. Core API Documentation
* **Google GenAI SDK (Python):** [Official Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/genai) — Bookmark this. You will need it for understanding how to pass System Instructions, force JSON schemas, and handle rate limits.

## Week 2: Learning Resources

Read this before you start coding. It covers the ideas behind the three tasks so you understand what you are building. You do not need to finish every link so, pick what fills your gaps.

### A note on the model we use (please read)

In Week 1 you used **Gemini 2.5 Flash**. It works, but it burns through a lot of tokens quickly, so the free quota runs out fast and it can get slow or rate-limited during practice. From this week on, **do not use Gemini 2.5 Flash**. Use the **Groq API** instead — it is fast, has a generous free tier. All AI tasks below assume Groq.

### Groq API key setup

1. Go to https://console.groq.com/keys
2. Sign in and click **Create API Key**. Copy the key (you only see it once).
3. In the project root, open the `.env` file and add this line:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=paste-your-key-here
   ```
4. In your code, load it like this (never hardcode the key):
   ```python
   import os
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   from groq import Groq

   load_dotenv()
   client = Groq(api_key=os.environ["GROQ_API_KEY"])
   ```

Do not share this key or push it to GitHub. Keep your API key in `.env`, never in your code. Make sure `.env` is written inside your `.gitignore` file.

### Tool / function calling with Groq

An LLM can do more than chat: you can give it tools (real Python functions). The model decides when a tool is needed, your code runs it and sends the result back, and the model uses that result to write its final answer. This is exactly the flow you build in the first task.

### Browser automation with Playwright

Playwright lets your code open a real browser, visit pages, type, click, and read what is on screen. You use this to open a website and to search and play a video.

# Week 3 Learning 

Read this before you start coding. It covers the one new idea this week: the ReAct loop. You do not need every link — pick what fills your gaps.

## What you should already know

- Week 2, `basic_tool.py`: a Groq agent that calls one tool, gets the result back as a `"role": "tool"` message, then answers. It does this for exactly one round.
- Week 2, `browser_test.py`: opening a page with Playwright and reading elements with locators.

Week 3 joins these two. The tool the agent calls is now a Playwright function, and the single round becomes a real loop.

## The one new idea: ReAct (Reason + Act)

A plain LLM only knows its training data. It cannot tell you today's top story or the current price of anything. ReAct fixes this by letting the model alternate between thinking and using tools:

1. **Reason** — decide what is missing.
2. **Act** — call a tool to get it.
3. **Observe** — read the tool's result.
4. **Repeat** — reason again; act again if needed.
5. **Answer** — reply once it has enough.

The model decides when to act. You supply the tools.

```
User:        What's the top story on Hacker News right now?
Thought:     No live data. Search the web.
Action:      search_the_web("top story Hacker News")
Observation: "Show HN: I built a database in Rust — 482 points..."
Thought:     Got it. Answer.
Answer:      The top story is "Show HN: I built a database in Rust" (482 points).
```

## The loop in code (the upgrade from Week 2)

An LLM call is stateless. The only memory is the `messages` list you resend every call. Each turn it grows: `user` -> `assistant` (a tool call) -> `tool` (your result) -> `assistant` (text).

In `basic_tool.py` you ran the tool **once**, then made a second call for the final answer. That is a ReAct loop with the loop removed. This week you put the loop back:

```python
while True:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(model=MODEL, messages=messages, tools=tools)
    msg = response.choices[0].message
    messages.append(msg)

    if not msg.tool_calls:        # plain text -> done
        print(msg.content)
        break

    for call in msg.tool_calls:   # model wants to act
        result = available_tools[call.function.name](**json.loads(call.function.arguments))
        messages.append({
            "role": "tool",
            "tool_call_id": call.id,
            "name": call.function.name,
            "content": json.dumps(result),
        })
    # loop again — the model now sees the result and can act again
```

That is the whole brain. The model can now search, read what came back, and search again before answering — something the single round in Week 2 could not do.

## Resources 

You already have the Groq tool-use docs and Playwright docs from Week 2 — reuse them. These are the new ones for the concept:


- ReAct project page, with diagrams: https://react-lm.github.io/
- Anthropic, "Building Effective Agents" (framework-free, very readable): https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents
- Lilian Weng, "LLM Powered Autonomous Agents": https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/ (Just skim through this or use AI for summary)

Keeping this week's resources a bit lite , Let's majorly focus on the coding tasks.
We build the loop from scratch — no LangChain, no LlamaIndex. It is about 30 lines, and every framework is just a wrapper around it.

Setup is the same as Week 2 (same `.env`, same Groq key, same model). Now go to `README_TASKS.md`.
